- Additional Video Tutorials and Instructions: Available in the provided Resources and Tutorials section.

 Key Steps
1. Create EMR Cluster: Set up an Amazon EMR cluster with HBase.
2. Enable SSH Access: Configure SSH access to the EMR cluster.
3. Launch HBase Shell: Access the HBase shell via SSH.
4. Execute Commands: Try out HBase commands such as create, put, get, and scan, as per the instructions from the slides.

 Project Deliverable
- Screenshot of the HBase shell showing the results of the scan query.

 Usage
- Follow the instructions in the AWS documentation to set up the EMR cluster and HBase.
- Use SSH to connect to the cluster and access the HBase shell.
- Execute the HBase commands and capture a screenshot of the scan query results.

 Neo4j Lab Project README

 Project Overview
This project involves launching a Neo4j sandbox and completing the “Graph Data Science” project. If issues arise with the sandbox, the project includes steps to create a free account on Neo4j Aura and explore either the movie or airport database.

 Neo4j Lab Guide
- Neo4j Sandbox: [Neo4j Sandbox](https://sandbox.neo4j.com/)
- Neo4j Aura Free Account Creation: [Neo4j Aura Free](https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura-free/)
- Movie Database Exploration: ":play movie-graph" in Neo4j prompt.
- Airport Database Exploration: Import the airport database dump file and execute queries.

 Key Steps
1. Launch Neo4j Sandbox: Try completing the “Graph Data Science” project on the Neo4j sandbox.
2. Alternative Neo4j Aura Setup: If the sandbox is unresponsive, set up a free tier instance on Neo4j Aura.
3. Database Exploration: 
    - For the movie database, follow the ":play movie-graph" tutorial.
    - For the airport database, import the dump file and explore using queries.
4. Visualize Schema: Use "CALL db.schema.visualization()" for schema visualization in Neo4j.

 Project Deliverables
- Screenshot of the visualization produced using "CALL db.schema.visualization()", or from the final step of the movie database exploration.

 Usage
- Start by attempting the Neo4j Sandbox project.
- If issues occur, switch to Neo4j Aura and follow the steps for account creation and database setup.
- Explore the databases as per the instructions and capture a screenshot of the final step or schema visualization.
