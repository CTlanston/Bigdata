 AWS RedShift Lab Project README

 Project Overview
This project follows the steps outlined in the AWS RedShift Lab, which involves setting up an AWS RedShift cluster, loading data into it, and performing basic queries. The aim is to submit the first five rows of all tables loaded into RedShift at the end of section 2.1.5 of the lab.

 Lab Guide
- AWS RedShift Lab Tutorial: [AWS RedShift Lab](https://zacks.one/aws-redshift-lab/)

 Key Steps
1. Set Up RedShift Cluster: Follow the lab guide to set up an AWS RedShift cluster.
2. Load Data: Load the specified datasets into the RedShift cluster.
3. Query Data: Execute SQL queries to retrieve the first five rows from each table loaded into RedShift.

 Technical Notes
- AWS Role: The role “myRedshiftRole” already exists in the AWS Academy account, so there's no need to create it as mentioned in the lab.
- AWS Issues: For any AWS-related technical issues, contact Ron Harris and cc the instructor.

 Project Deliverables
- Screenshots or text files containing the first five rows of all tables loaded into RedShift at the end of section 2.1.5.

 Usage
- Follow the lab guide step by step to set up the RedShift cluster and perform the data loading and querying tasks.
- Ensure all AWS configurations and permissions are correctly set up as per the lab requirements.

Note: This README provides a summary of the project. For detailed instructions and troubleshooting, refer to the lab guide and AWS documentation.
